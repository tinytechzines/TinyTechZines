# Media Release / Consent Form

This agreement is made between Tiny Tech Zines and ____________________ for participation in "Tiny Tech Zines" on **August 11, 2019** from **11am to 7pm**.

We are interested in facilitating an accessible, caring, and critically engaging space for disempowered communities to share their stories and experiences with technology. To that end, we may take photos and videos of yourself, your goods, and related activities during our time together at Tiny Tech Zines. These may be published and tagged on our social media accounts (@tinytechzines) and other platforms. We will use these recordings only to advocate for your work with our networks and communities, and to support the maintenance and sustainability of Tiny Tech Zines as a community-driven initiative organized by individuals with shared values.

I acknowledge that these terms are fluid, and consent may be given/withdrawn at any point leading up to and during the event with written or verbal communication. If, presently, I am comfortable with how TTZ has described their use for media representing myself and/or my work, I will indicate by signing below.
