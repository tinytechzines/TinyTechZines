# Media Release / Consent Form

The Tiny Tech Zines (TTZ) team is intentional about forming an accessible, caring, and critical space for all of us to engage with technology. To that end, the TTZ team may take photos and videos of yourself, your work, and your activities during our time together at Tiny Tech Zines. We may publish and tag these on our social media accounts (@tinytechzines). We will contact you again for your consent if there is an opportunity to share this documentation with press. The TTZ team will use these recordings only to advocate for your work with our networks and communities.

I acknowledge that these terms are fluid, and consent may be given and/or withdrawn at any point leading up to the event with written or verbal communication. During TTZ, I can also communicate my consent with a sticker or button that will be provided for me.

- [] I consent to be photographed and/or recorded.
- [] I do not consent to be photographed and/or recorded.
