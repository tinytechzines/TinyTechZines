# Media Release / Consent Form

The Tiny Tech Zines (TTZ) team is intentional about forming an accessible, caring, and critical space for all of us to engage with technology. To that end, the TTZ team may take photos and videos of yourself, your work, and your activities during our time together at Tiny Tech Zines. We may publish and tag these on our social media accounts (@tinytechzines). We will reach out again for your consent if there is an opportunity to share this documentation on other platforms or with press.

The TTZ team will use these recordings only to advocate for your work with our networks and communities, and to support the sustenance of Tiny Tech Zines as an alternative space for peripheral communities to have critical encounters with technology. 

I acknowledge that these terms are fluid, and consent may be given/withdrawn at any point leading up to and during the event with written or verbal communication. If, presently, I am comfortable with how TTZ has described their uses for media representing myself and/or my work, I will indicate by signing below.
