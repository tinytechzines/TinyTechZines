# Terms of Participation
This section of the agreement summarizes the information from your application that describes your participation in TTZ, and outlines some materials we'd like to request that we'll use to introduce you to everyone else who will be sharing space with us. These conditions are flexible, always; just let us know how we can accommodate you if anything changes.

**Setup and takedown**  
TTZ will be open to the public at 11 a.m. and will end at 7 p.m. I will have access to the space as early as 8 a.m. and agree to be at NAVEL before 11 a.m. to set up my table, and have everything taken down by 9 p.m.

**Tabling**  
I will be provided a table according to the option I chose in my application. If I opted to bring my own table I will send details and table dimensions to the TTZ team so they can plan accordingly.

**Sales**  
I am responsible for handling my transactions throughout the day. Pricing for each item is at my discretion. I will keep 100% of my sales.

**Zines & other works**  
I will provide the TTZ team with a final inventory of the zines and other work I will be having at my table. This will be sent by July 28. I agree to check in with them if these items change.

**Biographical bits**  
I recognize that this is an intimate event that emphasizes connection and community. I will support this by sending TTZ a short 50-word bio that responds to any and/or all of the following: my background, my work, my interest in tabling at TTZ, my relationship with technology, what I need from it, what excites me about it, what implementation of technology would make me feel loved and cared for, etc. If I'm comfortable, I'll also send an image (of myself, a thing, a feeling) that represents these sentiments, along with any social media accounts I'd like to be tagged with.

**Cancellation**  
I acknowledge that confirming my participation now is a reflection of my present capacity to table at TTZ, and that this capacity can change at any point between now and the event. If it does, I'll make every effort to notify the team at least 14 days prior to the event.

My signature below communicates that I have received and understand these terms and will send the requested materials before June 30th, 2019.
