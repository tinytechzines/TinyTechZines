# Terms of Participation
This section of the agreement summarizes the information from your application that describes your participation in TTZ, and outlines some materials we'd like to request that we'll use to introduce you to everyone else who will be sharing space with us. These conditions are flexible, always; just let us know how we can accommodate you if anything changes.

**Setup and takedown**  
TTZ will be open to the public at 11am and will end at 7pm. I will be at NAVEL by, at least, 9am to set up my table, and have everything taken down by 9pm.

**Tabling**  
I confirm my use of a full or half table, unless I indicated that I'll be bringing my own table/display. In either case, I commit to making my configuration respectful to the space and accessible to its participants.

**Fee**  
I will make a payment of $25 to TTZ. This payment will be sent via PayPal to paypal.me/tinytechzines. Alternatively, I can send with Venmo to @tinytechzines. If this fee becomes a difficulty for me, I will check in with Rachel, Tyler, and Tristan. I can expect this fee to be refunded if I become unable to table at TTZ.

**Biographical bits**  
I recognize that this is an intimate event that emphasizes connection and community. I will support this by sending TTZ a short 50-word bio that responds to any and/or all of the following: my background, my work, my interest in tabling at TTZ, my relationship with technology, what I need from it, what excites me about it, what implementation of technology would make me feel loved and cared for, etc. If I'm comfortable, I'll also send an image (of myself, a thing, a feeling) that represents these sentiments.

**Cancellation**  
I acknowledge that confirming my participation now is a reflection of my present capacity to table at TTZ, and that this capacity can change at any point between now and the event. If it does, I'll notify the team as soon as I'm able to. If my withdrawal presents a logistical difficulty for TTZ, I will consult with Rachel, Tyler, and Tristan on an alternative accommodation.

A signature below communicates that I've comprehended these terms and will send the requested materials within a compassionate timeframe.
