# Terms of Participation
This section of the agreement summarizes the information from your application that describes your participation in TTZ, and outlines some materials we'd like to request that we'll use to introduce you to everyone else who will be sharing space with us. These conditions are flexible, always; just let us know how we can accommodate you if anything changes.

**Setup and takedown**
TTZ will be open to the public at 11am and will end at 7pm. I will be at NAVEL by, at least, 9am to set up my table, and have everything taken down by 9pm.
