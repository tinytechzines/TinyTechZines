# Terms of Participation
This section of the agreement summarizes the information from your application that describes your participation in TTZ, and outlines some materials we'd like to request that we'll use to introduce you to everyone else who will be sharing space with us. These conditions are flexible, always; just let us know how we can accommodate you if anything changes.

**Setup and takedown**  
TTZ will be open to the public at 11 a.m. and will end at 7 p.m. I agree to be at NAVEL before 11 a.m. to set up my table, and have everything taken down by 9 p.m.

**Tabling**  
I confirm my use of a __________ (full/half/own) display. I commit to making my configuration respectful to the space and accessible to all TTZ attendees.

**Fee**  
I will make a payment of $25 to TTZ. This payment can be sent via PayPal to paypal.me/tinytechzines, or with Venmo to @tinytechzines. I may also pay with cash by meeting up with the team IRL before or on the day of the event. I will inform them of my preferred payment method, or reach out if I need an alternative. If this fee becomes a difficulty for me, I will check in with Rachel, Tyler, and Tristan. I can expect this fee to be refunded if I become unable to table at TTZ.

**Sales**  
I am responsible for handling my transactions throughout the day. Pricing for each item is at my discretion. I will keep 100% of my sales.

**Zines & other works**  
I proposed having __________ [Tech Zines 1/2/3] at my table, along with __________ [shirts/buttons/other merch]. I agree to provide this work for TTZ, and to consult with them if these items change.

**Biographical bits**  
I recognize that this is an intimate event that emphasizes connection and community. I will support this by sending TTZ a short 50-word bio that responds to any and/or all of the following: my background, my work, my interest in tabling at TTZ, my relationship with technology, what I need from it, what excites me about it, what implementation of technology would make me feel loved and cared for, etc. If I'm comfortable, I'll also send an image (of myself, a thing, a feeling) that represents these sentiments, along with any social media accounts I'd like to be tagged with.

**Cancellation**  
I acknowledge that confirming my participation now is a reflection of my present capacity to table at TTZ, and that this capacity can change at any point between now and the event. If it does, I'll make every effort to notify the team at least 14 days prior to the event.

My signature below communicates that I have received and understand these terms and will send the requested materials before June 30th, 2019.
