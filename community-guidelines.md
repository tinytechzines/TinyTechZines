# Community Guidelines

## INTENT
Technology is often alienating to diverse communities. Our intent with Tiny Tech Zines is to disengage from these paradigms, in favor of something more caring and rhizomatic. We offer TTZ as an opportunity to contribute to this in modes that are collaborative and accessible. In the process, we hope to emphasize community, critically engage with technology, and decolonize in a meaningful way.

We have absolutely zero tolerance for any behavior that reinforces social inequities and power imbalances, especially offensive comments and actions made towards anyone along the spectra of gender, sexuality, ability, neurotype, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, body, age, appearance, skill level. If an individual witnesses these behaviors, they may report it to any organizing member for immediate action.

Everyone who participates in/with TTZ abides by these guidelines, including: the organizing team, speakers, vendors, volunteers, attendees.

## GUIDELINES
Since Tiny Tech Zines 2019 will take place at NAVEL in Los Angeles, we encourage all participants to read and embody their code of conduct, which is available [here](https://navel.la/about/code-of-conduct/ "Navel Code of Conduct").

The initial draft of these guidelines was inspired by a number of organizations and collectives with whom we share goals and values, including the Processing Foundation, Distributed Web of Care, the Women's Center for Creative Work, and NAVEL.

**Care deeply, in different directions**

TTZ emerged from a realization of our shared vulnerabilities with technology. We want to shift from these models of exploitation to ones of care and empathy. We believe that flesh is more than data, that flesh cannot be optimized, that flesh is real and fluid and unfathomable. We ask others to care for each other in a way that acknowledges the reality of always being in a relationship - with many people, many things, many selves - and to refuse a frame of reference which seeks to make flesh an instrument for capital.

**Consent, and an attentiveness to needs and boundaries**

As with all relationships, TTZ seeks to establish boundaries with all of our artists, communities, and collaborators. We pay attention to emerging needs and ask for consent at every step. Our understanding of consent is heavily shaped by Planned Parenthood's FRIES model, where consent is: freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific. We also believe that consent extends beyond sexual encounters and physical relationships. We expect our community members to respect and advocate for each other's choice and autonomy, and to practice this in every encounter together.

**Collectivism over individualism**

Under capitalism, our communities have been atomized, emphasizing individual performance and competition. We don't view this as a sustainable approach. Our problems are complex, and networked, and we must respond similarly. TTZ will always prefer collaborative responses to our shared challenges. We commit to cultivating more intentional manifestations of inclusivity, accessibility, and co-ownership, and ask our community to participate with a similar mindset.

**Accountability through transparency**

Accountability is a constant process involving patience, vulnerability, and empathy. We acknowledge our shorcomings and encourage our collaborators to hold TTZ and each other accountable through critique and conversation. We do this for each other - tenderly, when possible - and always without invalidating experiences or emotions. To uphold this principle, TTZ will be making our organizational model - as it relates to our funding, thought processes, ways of working, administrative protocols, and internal documents (including this one) - publicly available online and at the request of any collaborator.
