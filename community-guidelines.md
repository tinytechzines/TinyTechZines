# Community Guidelines

## INTENT
Technology is often alienating to diverse communities. Our intent with Tiny Tech Zines is to disengage from these frameworks, in favor of something more caring and interconnected. In the process, we hope to emphasize community, provide a space for critical learning, and decolonize technology in a meaningful way.

We have absolutely zero tolerance for behaviors that reinforce social inequities and power imbalances, especially offensive comments and actions made towards anyone along the spectra of gender, sexuality, ability, neurotype, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, body, age, appearance, skill level. 

Everyone who participates in/with TTZ abides by these guidelines, including: the organizing team, speakers, workshop leaders, authors, volunteers, attendees.

## GUIDELINES
Since Tiny Tech Zines 2019 will take place at NAVEL in Los Angeles, we encourage all participants to read and embody their code of conduct, which is available [here](https://navel.la/about/code-of-conduct/ "Navel Code of Conduct").

The initial draft of these guidelines was inspired by a number of organizations and collectives with whom we share goals and values, including the Processing Foundation, Distributed Web of Care, the Women's Center for Creative Work, BUFU and NAVEL.

**Care deeply, in different directions**  
Present forms of technology engage our bodies by exerting force and control. We want to shift from these models to ones of care and empathy. We believe that life is more than data, that life cannot be optimized, that life is real and fluid and unfathomable. We ask others to care for each other in a way that acknowledges the reality of always being in relation, and to refuse a frame of reference that makes life an instrument for capital.

**Consent and self-determination**  
Our understanding of consent is heavily shaped by Planned Parenthood’s FRIES model, where consent is: freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific. We also believe that consent extends beyond sexual encounters and physical relationships. We expect our community members to advocate for each other’s choice and autonomy in every encounter together.

**Collectivism over individualism**  
We believe that an unchecked emphasis on individualism and competition can lead to dismantling of communities. We don’t view this as a sustainable approach. Our problems are complex and networked, and we must respond similarly. We commit to cultivating more intentional manifestations of inclusivity, accessibility, and co-ownership, and ask our community to participate with a similar mindset.

**Accountability through transparency**  
Accountability is a constant process involving patience, vulnerability, and empathy. We acknowledge our shortcomings and encourage our collaborators to hold TTZ and each other accountable through critique and conversation. We do this for each other - tenderly, when possible - and always without invalidating experiences or emotions. In support, TTZ will be making our organizational model - as it relates to our funding, thought processes, ways of working, administrative protocols, and internal documents (including this one) - publicly available online and at the request of any collaborator.

## SAFETY
As a collaborator with TTZ, I recognize that I am responsible for the co-creation of this space. If I or someone I notice needs support, I will call (909) 800-5614. If I am trained in community-oriented strategies for addressing conflict (i.e., transformative justice principles), and have the capacity to provide support and safety, I may do so at my discretion.

I WILL NOT CALL THE POLICE. Black and brown bodies are constantly murdered and abused by the police. I will not involve them in our space. 

I acknowledge that if I am the one to breach these agreements, then -  depending on the severity of the circumstances and my proximity to privilege - I may be asked to leave. It's possible to participate in future events after an extended conversation, but the needs of the survivor will always be prioritized.

By signing below, I indicate that I have received the TTZ Community Guidelines, and agree to embody them.
